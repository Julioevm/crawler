Its turn-based, and the levels are based around a grid of cells.

The player controls a party of up to 6 characters.

Enemies encountered patrolling the dungeons might be alone or a group of multiple enemies.


## Game World

There will be chests, traps and other interactive elements in the map.

The player can encounter doors, doors locked by keys or mechanical doors that need to be open from somewhere else in the dungeon.

Maps are inter-connected in non linear ways. Shortcuts can be unlocked. 

There will be multiple themes for the maps.

### Characters

WIP

### Combat

Each turn your party trades blows with the enemies in the opposing party.

The party members can attack, cast spells (or use abilities), use items from the inventory or guard (increase defense and take no further action.)

Additionally you might attempt to flee, succeeding will avoid the current battle, failing will lose your turn.


### Inventory

The whole party shares a common inventory.
Each character in the party can equip or use equipment separately.
